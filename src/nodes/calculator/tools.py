"""
Node B: Calculator - Private Tools

This module contains financial calculation utilities:
1. Valuation ratio calculations (P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA, ROE, ROA, etc.)
2. DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) model implementation
3. Three-statement model reconciliation helpers
4. Financial data validation

All calculations are pure Python - no LLM involvement to ensure accuracy.
